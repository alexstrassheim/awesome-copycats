Installation
============

<<<<<<< HEAD
With Git: ::
||||||| merged common ancestors
.. code-block:: shell

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats.git
    $ mv -bv awesome-copycats/* ~/.config/awesome; rm -r awesome-copycats

Usage
=====

The modular structure allows to

* set variables
* define startup processes
* change keybindings and layouts
* set client properties

in ``rc.lua``, and

* configure widgets
* define wiboxes and screen settings

in ``theme.lua``, so that you just need to change ``chosen_theme`` variable in ``rc.lua`` to preserve your preferences *and* switch the theme, instead of having N different ``rc.lua`` full of redundancy.

Just do the following:

.. code-block:: shell
